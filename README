This is my .emacs.d folder. I've tried to keep consistent across machines running Debian Squeeze and Snow Leopard. Currently all the settings are dumped in init.el. 

How is this different from emacs-starter-kit you ask? I tried customizing the emacs-starter-kit but I couldn't satisfactorily make that happen. Most of my frustrations revolved around ELPA and it's brittleness. Also, I wanted to churn out some Elisp code.

To start using this, do the following:

cd ~						# Go to your home folder	    
rm .emacs					# Remove the .emacs file if it exists
git clone https://github.com/habib/.emacs.d.git # Clone this repository
cd .emacs.d					
git submodule init				# Update the dependencies
git submodule update 				# Wait patiently if you hail from a bandwidth starved nation

The .gitmodules file will tell you that most of the packages are from https://github.com/emacsmirror/ . That's an awesome resource and I thank the maintainers. 

The themes are stored in the 'themes' folder. I prefer zenburn; choose your own and dump it there and modify the init.el file accordingly. All the packages are stored in the 'packages' folder. These may include:

android-mode, auto-complete, color-theme, emacs-ide, full-ack, fullscreen, js2-mode, magit, mode-compile, paredit, rhtml, rspec-mode, ruby-electric, rvm, shoulda-mode, slime, textmate, yaml-mode, yasnippet and yasnippets.

This list may not be exhaustive.

You'll need to install ack (or ack-grep), exuberant-ctags and cscope for all the packages to work.
